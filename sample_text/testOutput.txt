he entered a little street in which there were many gardens. some of
them are enclosed only by hedges, which lends a cheerful aspect to the
street. in the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a
small house of a single story, the window of which was lighted up. he
peered through the pane as he had done at the public house. within was a
large whitewashed room, with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff, and
a cradle in one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a double-barrelled gun
hanging on the wall. a table was spread in the centre of the room. a
copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter
jug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown, smoking
soup-tureen. at this table sat a man of about forty, with a merry and
open countenance, who was dandling a little child on his knees. close by
a very young woman was nursing another child. the father was laughing,
the child was laughing, the mother was smiling.

the stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calming
spectacle. what was taking place within him? he alone could have

hospitable, and that, in a place where he beheld so much happiness, he
would find perhaps a little pity.
